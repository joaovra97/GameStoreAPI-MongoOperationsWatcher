# Game Store API - Mongo Operations Watcher

This project is designed to simulate both parallel and non-parallel batch operations on a MongoDB database via an API. 
The project can be used as a skeleton for creating Proof of Concepts (POCs) and performance tests using MongoDB with [MongoDb C# Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/#mongodb-c--driver).

The API includes 5 parameterized batch operations. All operations return the total response time, allowing for performance comparisons.

## Documentation

For more details on the available operations and how to use them, please refer to the Swagger documentation included with the project.
